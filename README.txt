This repository has many of the files given in my CMPUT 275, Introduction to 
Tangible Computing II. Not every file was uploaded as they weren't documented at
all or were even simpler versions of the same files. Many files require
the context given, which I may not have record in this class.

Not all of the code is mine, such as the makefiles and many of the functions as
our tasks were to complete or edit code given. 

Class: CMPUT 275, "Introduction to Tangible Computing II" from University of Alberta.
